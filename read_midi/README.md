Polyphonic Tuner
================

This is a device that can be connected to any MIDI instrument
and will analyze the notes that this MIDI instrument will
play.  If the MIDI device is playing a triadic chord, the tuner
will identify the root/quality of the chord and display it.
This device is designed for new musicians, particularly new 
pianists or guitarists.  This device will enable musicians to 
see exactly what they're playing and help develop their 
ear training.
